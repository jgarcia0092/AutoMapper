# 13.0 Upgrade Guide

[Release notes](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/releases/tag/v13.0.0).

## AutoMapper now targets .Net 6

## `AddAutoMapper` is part of the core package and the DI package is discontinued

## `IMapper` has nullable annotations

Besides the build-time impact, there is also a behaviour change. Non-generic `Map` overloads require now either a destination type or a non-null destination object.

## `AllowAdditiveTypeMapCreation` was removed

Be sure to call `CreateMap` once for a source type, destination type pair. If you want to reuse configuration, use mapping inheritance.
