# 8.1.1 Upgrade Guide

## AutoMapper no longer creates maps automatically by default

`CreateMissingTypeMaps` was deprecated, and its default value changed to `false`. This is a breaking change, and the feature is removed entirely in 9.0.

There are two ways to handle this, namely:

- Prepare for 9.0 by explicitly configuring maps, manually or using reflection.
- Temporarily restore the behaviour of 8.1.0 and earlier by setting `CreateMissingTypeMaps` to `true`.
