# 8.0 Upgrade Guide

## ProjectUsing

The `ProjectUsing` method consolidated with `ConvertUsing`:

```c#
// IMappingExpression

// Old
void ConvertUsing(Func<TSource, TDestination> mappingFunction);
void ProjectUsing(Expression<Func<TSource, TDestination>> mappingExpression);

// New
void ConvertUsing(Expression<Func<TSource, TDestination>> mappingExpression);
```

To migrate, replace all usages of `ProjectUsing` with `ConvertUsing`.

The `ConvertUsing` expression-based method will be used for both in-memory mapping and LINQ projections. You cannot have separate configuration for in-memory vs. LINQ projections.

### Existing `ConvertUsing` usages

The change from `Func` to `Expression` may break some existing usages. Namely:

- `ConvertUsing` using lambda statements, method groups, or delegates
- Dual configuration of `ProjectUsing` and `ConvertUsing`

For the first case, you may either:

- Convert to a lambda expression
- Move to the `Func`-based overloads

The `Func`-based overloads accept more parameters, so you may have to add the parameters to your delegates.

### Motivation

Simplify overloads, and to make it clear that you cannot have separate configuration for LINQ projections vs. in-memory mapping.
