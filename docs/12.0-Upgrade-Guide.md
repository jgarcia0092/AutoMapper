# 12.0 Upgrade Guide

[Release notes](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/releases/tag/v12.0.0).

## Equivalent settings overwrite each other

That applies per map and also per member. For example, you can have only one type converter per map and only one resolver per member. 

It might not be obvious that some settings are equivalent. For example, a value converter is a special kind of resolver, so a `ConvertUsing` will overwrite a `MapFrom` 
for the same member. 

You also cannot have for the same map/member separate configurations for `Map` and `ProjectTo`.

Another possible occurence is with `ForAllMaps` and `ForAllPropertyMaps` when it's possible to overwrite things already set in a particular map.

## `ResolutionContext.Options` was removed

You should use `ResolutionContext.Items` to access the items passed in the `Map` call.

Instead of `ServiceCtor` you should use dependency injection or pass the needed objects in the `Map` call.
